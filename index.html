          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <p>I developed a Telegram bot called Buggy, which recommends movies and TV series based on user preferences. The bot allows users to filter recommendations by genre, region, and personal preferences. It also includes features like "I don't like this" to get different suggestions and "More like this" for similar recommendations.</p>

        <div class="project">
          <h3>Project 2</h3>
          <p>Created a simple yet responsive portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects. The website includes sections like "Home," "About Me," and "Portfolio." It demonstrates my ability to work with HTML and CSS to create clean, visually appealing web pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
          <h3>Project 3</h3>
          <p>Developed a blog layout using HTML and CSS, featuring a clean, minimalist design. The blog includes a homepage with an introduction, an "About Me" section, and a blog post preview area. It’s designed to be easy to navigate, with focus on readability and aesthetics.</p>
